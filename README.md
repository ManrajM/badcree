<h1>A Website for ENG3U0-H Bad Cree Reading Group</h1>

Throughout the time given for our bad cree reading group "summative" we have taken information from the book and have broken it up into key parts.
Throughout the website you will be given many (4-5) challenging puzzles which test the knowledge gained from our presentation as well as knowledge gained throughout the website.

We created this website for a multitude of reasons
<li>Learning and teaching others about the cree language</li>
<li>Teaching others about the culture of the Cree peoples</li>
<li>Learning about Cree culture as well as their stories and the meanings behind them</li>





We would appreciate it if you would create a github account and star our project as it took a lot of time and effort to bring this to you all
