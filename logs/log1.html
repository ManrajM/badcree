    <h3>Log - 1: King of the Skies</h3>
    <p>
        The great guardian, the protector, a true king of the skies. 
        The Thunderbird is a creature one should truly admire. 
        These creatures are known for their great size as well as their protection of humans. 
        The reason behind its name is that whenever it beats its wings, the roar of thunder comes from them. 
        They bring storms where they tread and legends have it that some can pick up whales with their talons. 
        These beasts are respected and revered and have also been credited with being the ones to have given the sacred pipe to 
        the people. This bird was also a representation of summer while its counterpart the White Owl represented the winter season. 
        It also is stated to be the one who controls the upper world while the underworld is controlled by the Underwater Panther or 
        Great Horned Serpent. They are also known to shapeshift. Revere these birds, for they truly rule the skies.
